In this project, I analyzed Yelp and Census data using Snowflake. The goal of this project was analyze relationships between the two datasets on a chosen topic. I decided to analyze the relationship between restaurant star ratings and different demographics.

Business Question: How do stars differ with income and population by state level?

Hypotheses: (1) States with higher population will have higher average star rating. 
            (2) Average stars are going to be lower for states with higher average income. 
            (3) Stars are going to be of wider range with states that have a higher population. 

Conclusion: One single demographic doesn't fully explain changes in average stars. Instead, there would be further value in exploring different combinations of demographics to see how that affects average star ratings.
